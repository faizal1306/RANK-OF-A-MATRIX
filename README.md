# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
## Step 1: 
We have imported numpy which is needed.
## Step 2: 
We have created a matrix by using np.array with different values in it.
## Step 3: 
Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
## Step 4: 
Finally, print the value of the rank of the matrix.
## Program:
program to find the rank of a matrix.
## Program:
```

import numpy as np
a = np.array([[5,-3,-10],[2,2,-3],[-3,-1,5]])
c = np.linalg.matrix_rank(a)
print(c)
```
